All projects in this language were done outside of my studies. I had the chance to use an SQLite database, parse commands using the console and predict the seasonality of sales. Additionally, I created my model for customer segmentation that compares two groups and indicates which one should be targeted. In this case, the requests are sent using JSON from Postman. 

### Some of my projects:

|Project|Description|
|:---|:---|
|[Prediction using the Prophet](https://kamilkandzia.github.io/prophet/)|Build a prediction model by the Prophet to indicate if the credit could be granted to some stores. For the stores, there is information about the revenue of the alcohol sales. The clustering has been implemented to find stores with similar attributes.|
|[To do list via CLI](https://kamilkandzia.github.io/todolist/)|To-do list created in Python. Data is stored in the database by using SQLite. The argparse package is used to parse the arguments from the CLI.|
