# Hello!
Let me bring through my webpage but at the beginning some word about me. 

I'm Kamil, currently working in the largest ecommerce platform in Poland as the Data Analyst. 

During my bachelor studies, I realized that I want to do something other than work in the factory as an automation control engineer. For my bachelor thesis ("Comparison of algorithms and structures for processing biomedical data"), I used Matlab to create the application with GUI. It had some statistician function, and that gave me some fun of working with big data files. At my university, a new "Data Science" course has been created, which was in the English language, so I chose it for the master's studies. During this course, I learn a lot about statistics, processing data and images, classifiers, big data environment, and data visualization.

All projects in python were done outside of my studies. I had the chance to use an SQLite database, parse commands using the console and predict the seasonality of sales. Additionally, I created my model for customer segmentation that compares two groups and indicates which one should be targeted. In this case, the requests are sent in JSON format by the Postman.
