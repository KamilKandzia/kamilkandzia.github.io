# Hello!
Let me bring through my webpage but at the beginning some word about me. 

I'm Kamil, currently working in one of the largest Polish banks. 

During my bachelor studies, I realized that I want to do something other than work in the factory as an automation control engineer. For my bachelor thesis ("Comparison of algorithms and structures for processing biomedical data"), I used Matlab to create the application with GUI. It had some statistician function, and that gave me some fun of working with big data files. At my university, a new "Data Science" course has been created, which was in the English language, so I chose it for the master's studies. During this course, I learn a lot about statistics, processing data and images, classifiers, big data environment, and data visualization.

The majority of projects in R posted on the website were done during my studies. The projects "Data Visualization" and "Hotel reservation" were created as part of self-development and improvement in this tool. Along I had the opportunity to use python. All projects in this language were done outside of my studies. Most of the activities were created for improving my skills. I had the chance to use an SQLite database, parse commands using the console and predict the seasonality of sales. Additionally, I created my model for customer segmentation that compares two groups and indicates which one should be targeted. In this case, the requests are sent using JSON from Postman.
