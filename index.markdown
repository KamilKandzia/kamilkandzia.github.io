# Hello!
Let me bring through my webpage but at the beginning some word about me. 

I'm Kamil, currently working in the Accenture Poland as the Data Engineer/Big Data Developer. 

During my bachelor studies, I realized that I want to do something other than work in the factory as an automation control engineer. At my university, a new Data Science course has been created. That was in the English language, so I chose it for my master's studies. During this course, I had the chance to learn a lot about statistics, processing data and images, classifiers, big data environment, and data visualization.

All projects in python were done outside of my studies. I had the chance to use an SQLite database, use the NLP in the identification of drug interactions from the summary of product characteristics, and predict the seasonality of sales. Additionally, I created my model for customer segmentation that compares two groups and indicates which one should be targeted. In this case, the requests are sent in JSON format by Postman.
